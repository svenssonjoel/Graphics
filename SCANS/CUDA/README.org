    1024 element scan in a single block using 32 threads. No Syncs!
  * sklansky2.cu 
    1024 element scan in a single block using 16 threads. No Syncs!



* TODOs: 
  * Test for correctness. 
  * Implement large scan (millions of elements).
  * Benchmark for performance. 
  * Try to push for as many elements as possible (per blocks)  with no syncs. 
  * Then try to push for as many elements as possible globally with as few 
    global syncs as possible (kernel invocations).
  * investigate is some schema using atomic ops can limit global syncs even 
    further.
