* Graphics
  + Graphics hobby projects
  + Gfx2 is the active project. 

* Examples 
  Currently only a few of these examples are in working order. This is 
  because of a change to the graphics library. 

  + dungeon: is working ok. 
  + feigenbaum: working
  + ground_mesh
  + info3ds
    working
  + show_feig 
  + simple2d
  + space
  + space2 
  + view3ds: working but buggy. 
  + viewmd2

  + diff_ms.h: Timing helpers/utils
  + error.c/h: Print OpenGL error messages
  + frame.c/h: Frames to transforms
  + image.c/h: Image loading and storing (supports RAW and PNG using libpng). 
    Also contains a set of 2d painting functions on images.

    matrix manipulation functionality. 
  + md2.c/h: Provides md2 loading and rendering (NEEDS TO BE UPDATED TO WORK) 
  + mesh.c/h: Meshes, collections of triangles that can be rendered in one "go".
  + multimesh.c/h: A wrapper around mesh to handle many "related" meshes at once. 
  + shader.c/h: Load and compile GLSL shaders.
  + shapes.c/h: Tools to generate some simple shapes.
  + sse_detect.h: Helpers if you want to detect SSE 
  + text.c/h: Put text on Images. 
  + texture.c/h: Helpers to manage OpenGL textures. 
  + tools.c/h: Currently only contains a drawLine function..
